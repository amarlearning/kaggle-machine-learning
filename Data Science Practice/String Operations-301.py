## 4. Changing the values of an immutable object ##

ed_sheeran = [list(row) for row in a_team]

## 5. Uppercasing And Lowercasing Strings ##

for row in ed_sheeran:
    row[1] = row[1].upper()
    
print(ed_sheeran)

## 6. Joining a list of strings into one string ##

ed_sheeran = ["".join(row) for row in ed_sheeran]
ed_sheeran_full = "\n".join(ed_sheeran)


print(default_testcases_ed_sheeran)

## 7. String Concatenation ##

ed_sheeran_full = ""
for row in ed_sheeran:
    ed_sheeran_full = str(ed_sheeran_full) + str(row) + str("\n") 

print(ed_sheeran_full)

## 8. Replacing Values In A String ##

mad_libs_joined = "\n".join(mad_libs)

mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{ADJ}", "stinky")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{NOUN}", "piano")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{AGE}", "99")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{NOUN_PLURAL}", "phones")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{VERB}", "crush")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{LOCATION}", "Antarctica")
mad_libs_joined = mad_libs_joined.replace("{CELEBRITY}", "Beyonce")

## 9. Replacing Values In A String Using Formatter ##

first_line = "White {0}, pale {1}"
first_line = first_line.format("hat", "skin")


## 10. Formatting our song lyrics ##

final = mad_libs.format(ADJ = "strong", NOUN = "piano", AGE = "99", NOUN_PLURAL = "phones", VERB = "smash", LOCATION = "Antarctica", CELEBRITY = "Beyonce")
